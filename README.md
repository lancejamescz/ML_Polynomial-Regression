# ML_Polynomial-Regression
Use a random seed to create a dataset which contains 100 samples (x, y),
the relationship follows 𝑦 = 𝑐𝑜𝑠(1.5𝜋 ∗ 𝑥). 
Then a noise to the y, 𝑟 = 𝑓 + e, (like the slide-chap4-03.pdf, P18), 
the noise follows the gaussian distribution. 
Also gets (x, r). polynomial regression (x, r) from degree = 1 to degree = 12, 
the 75% of data as training data and the 25% as the testing data 
and calculates the R square and the mean square error of each degree. Show the results of the scores, MSE and the plot.
